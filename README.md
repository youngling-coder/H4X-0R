### About

When I started creating this bot, it was conceived as an assistant and helper for when I wasn't online. But the more I worked on it, the more I wanted to add functions to it. It answers very well and qualitatively in groups and chats, moreover, imitating the general atmosphere of the conversation. It perfectly recognizes photos.

### To Do
- Add TTS for Hector
- Add summary of the chats when offline
- Add channel management
- Add database
- Add Docker
- Add group answers
